# anpr-aws-rekognition

This notebook can be used to fetch images from an aws s3 bucket, and to crop the windshield out of a car when a person is detected by the aws rekognition api.

You need to upload a folder with the images to aws s3. But also have a local copy of them, so you can open and edit the images in code.
